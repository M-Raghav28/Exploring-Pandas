**Project Overview**

This project aims to analyze and predict fitness-related metrics using the Gym Members Exercise Tracking Dataset. The dataset provides various features such as BMI, Session Duration, Heart Rate, and Calories Burned, enabling both regression and classification tasks.

The key objectives of this project are:

1. Predicting Calories Burned using Linear Regression.
2. Classifying Workout Types with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
3. Optimizing KNN performance by identifying the optimal number of neighbors (k).


The dataset consists of 973 entries with 15 features:

1. Numerical Features:

Age, Weight (kg), Height (m), Max_BPM, Avg_BPM, BMI, Calories_Burned, etc.

2. Categorical Features:

Gender, Workout_Type.

3. Target Variables:

For Regression: Calories_Burned.
For Classification: Workout_Type.
